zen-of-ticketdom
================

The Zen of Ticketdom -- A ticketing system made for humans, by humans.

This project is in rather heavy development (read: just started). Feel free to join in!

Check out ZEN_OF_TICKETDOM.py for my design document so far.

I want to develop this against GAE primarily, as I feel it would be a great excuse for me to learn that, while creating something I've always wanted in this world: a decent ticketing system for everyone.

Ideas for the future include:
    - Getting things GNOME integration
    - Hamster integration

I'll be starting a development chat room shortly.

Thanks for reading!
Trevor
